Today you sweat, tomorrow she wet
Less talking, more lifting
Fitness is like a marriage, you can't cheat on it and expect it to work
Life sucks, you suck
"Man who runs in front of car is tired, man who runs behind car is exhausted" - Confucius
"Only when a mosquito land on your balls, you will truly realize that there is a way to solve problems without using violence" - Confucius
"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take - Wayne Gtrezky" - Michael Scott 
Train hard, lift heavy
Please stretch before and after every workout
Hustle for that muscle
Sore today, strong tomorrow
Stop being a whiny lil bitch and just do it
Be as strong as an ant, be like Richie
